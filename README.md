# AWS Services - LaunchBar Action

A simple action to browse through AWS service groups and services and directly jump to the service home page in the AWS console.

## Installation

...

## Usage

Use your LaunchBar shortcut to bring LaunchBar to front and enter `aws`. From here you find a _Settings_ item at the top to configure your AWS region and an alternative browser to use when selecting a service while pressing the `alt`/`option` key.

*Hint*: due to frequent changes at the AWS console site, the list of services is currently downloaded from a gist. Feel free to try the "Update Services List" _Settings_ item to check for updates or contact me in case of missing services.
